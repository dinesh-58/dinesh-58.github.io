Hi! I'm Sujal, a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) student & internet-taught developer.
I've got a lot of project ideas, but have only started working on a few. 
You can find them in the portfolio page of this website. My specialties can be 
found on the homepage, most of which are web development. 
This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) & the 
[hugo-developer-portfolio](https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio/) theme. It also uses [freedns.afraid.org](freedns.afraid.org), if you are looking for a free, EZ way to manage DNS records for your domain, especially for free .com.np ones.   

<!-- TODO: use 88x31 button for freedns when I get around to the website rewrite -->
I am currently available for part-time/ freelance work.
