Hi! I'm Sujal, a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) student & internet-taught developer.
I've got a lot of project ideas, but have only started working on a few. You can find them in the portfolio page of this website. 
My specialties can be found on the homepage, of which most are web development.

I am currently available for part-time/ freelance work.
